# Epic: Monitoring and Logging
## Description:
* Set up version control and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines 
* Define and automate testing processes for more efficient development 
* Implement infrastructure as code to manage and provision resources 
* Establish a monitoring and alerting system for production
## Stories
* [As a developer, I want to use DevOps practices to improve the efficiency of our development process.](stories/story_DevOps.md)
##Test Plan
# Test Plan for DevOps Monitoring and Logging

## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the DevOps Monitoring and Logging system is working as expected and facilitating the lean management practice of build measure, lean so we can focus on product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development.

## Scope
This test plan covers the testing of the DevOps Monitoring and Logging system, including its configuration, monitoring, logging, and alerting features.

## Test Cases

### Configuration
1. Verify that the DevOps Monitoring and Logging system is properly configured according to the project's requirements.
2. Verify that the system is integrated with the project's version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the configuration files.
3. Verify that the system is configured to collect and analyze data from all relevant sources, including application logs, system logs, and network traffic.

### Monitoring
1. Verify that the system is continuously monitoring the project's infrastructure and applications for performance, availability, and security issues.
2. Verify that the system is configured to alert the appropriate team members when issues are detected.
3. Verify that the alerts are delivered through the appropriate channels (e.g., email, SMS, Slack).
4. Verify that the system is tracking and reporting on relevant metrics (e.g., response time, error rate, CPU usage) to enable data-driven decision making.

### Logging
1. Verify that the system is collecting logs from all relevant sources, including application logs, system logs, and network traffic.
2. Verify that the logs are properly structured and tagged to enable easy analysis and troubleshooting.
3. Verify that the logs are stored securely and can be easily accessed when needed.
4. Verify that the system is integrated with the project's version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the logging configuration.

## Conclusion
This test plan verifies that the DevOps Monitoring and Logging system is properly configured, monitoring the project's infrastructure and applications, and logging relevant data. The system is working as expected and facilitating the lean management practice of build measure, lean so we can focus on product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development. Any issues found during testing should be addressed and resolved to ensure the system is working as intended.
