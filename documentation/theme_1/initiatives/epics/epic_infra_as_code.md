# Epic: Infrastructure as Code
## Description: Consistent and automated way to provision and manage infrastructure resources.
## Stories
* [Quickly provision and configure new environments for development, testing, and production](stories/story_provision.md)
* [Able to audit and manage all infrastructure changes to ensure the security and compliance of the website](stories/story_audit.md)

##Test Plan
* Provisioning time: Measure the time it takes to provision a new environment. The process should be automated and take a few minutes at most.
* Configuration management: Check if the system has a configuration management tool such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef that can configure the new environment quickly and reliably. 
* Automated testing: Verify if automated testing is set up for the new environment. The new environment should be tested automatically before it is deployed. 
* Version control: Check if the system has version control for infrastructure code. This ensures that changes can be tracked and rolled back if necessary.
* Ensure that any changes made to the infrastructure are documented and communicated to all relevant parties. 
* Verify that the website's infrastructure is compliant with industry standards and regulations.
