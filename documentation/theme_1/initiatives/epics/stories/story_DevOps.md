# Story: DevOps practices to improve the efficiency of our development process
## Description: Able to automatically build and test code every time changes are made in order to catch errors early and deliver high-quality code more quickly.
## Tasks
* [Set up version control system (e.g. Git)](tasks/task_git.md)
* [Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment](tasks/task_ci_cd_pipeline.md)
* [Define and automate testing processes for efficient development](tasks/task_auto_testing.md)
* [Implement infrastructure as code using tools such as Terraform](tasks/task_infrastructure_as_code.md)
* [Set up a monitoring and alerting system for production environments](tasks/task_set_up_monitering_and_alerting.md)
##Test Plan
# Test Plan for DevOps Practices

## Introduction
The purpose of this test plan is to ensure that the DevOps practices implemented are efficient and facilitate the lean management practice of build measure, lean, so we can focus on product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development.

## Objectives
1. Ensure that the development process is efficient by implementing DevOps practices.
2. Ensure that the DevOps practices facilitate the lean management practice of build measure, lean.
3. Ensure that the product development process is focused on a pull process rather than a push process for feature development.

## Scope
This test plan covers the implementation and testing of DevOps practices, including but not limited to:
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Configuration Management
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and Alerting
- Automation
- Collaboration and Communication

## Test Strategy
1. Automated testing: Ensure that automated tests are set up to run after each code commit to the repository.
2. Code review: Ensure that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged into the repository.
3. Continuous integration: Ensure that code is integrated into the main branch regularly.
4. Continuous deployment: Ensure that new code changes are deployed automatically to a staging environment for testing.
5. Configuration management: Ensure that all configuration files are version-controlled and managed using a Configuration Management tool (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Puppet).
6. Infrastructure as Code: Ensure that all infrastructure is managed as code using a tool such as Terraform.
7. Monitoring and Alerting: Ensure that a monitoring and alerting system is set up for production environments.
8. Automation: Ensure that repetitive tasks are automated where possible to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency.
9. Collaboration and Communication: Ensure that there is effective collaboration and communication between all teams involved in the development process.

## Test Cases
1. Test that the automated tests are set up to run after each code commit to the repository.
2. Test that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged into the repository.
3. Test that code is integrated into the main branch regularly.
4. Test that new code changes are deployed automatically to a staging environment for testing.
5. Test that all configuration files are version-controlled and managed using a Configuration Management tool.
6. Test that all infrastructure is managed as code using a tool such as Terraform.
7. Test that a monitoring and alerting system is set up for production environments.
8. Test that repetitive tasks are automated where possible to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency.
9. Test that there is effective collaboration and communication between all teams involved in the development process.

## Conclusion
This test plan aims to ensure that the DevOps practices implemented are efficient and facilitate the lean management practice of build measure, lean, so we can focus on product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development.
