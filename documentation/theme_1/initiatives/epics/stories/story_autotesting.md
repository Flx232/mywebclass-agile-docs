# Story: Automatically build and test code every time changes are made
## Description: Able to automatically build and test code every time changes are made in order to catch errors early and deliver high-quality code more quickly.
## Tasks
* Set up a CI/CD pipeline
* Define the pipeline stages, including building, testing, and deployment. 
* Write unit and integration tests for the code. 
* Integrate the pipeline with version control system (VCS) like Git.
##Test Plan
* Test the pipeline by making a small code change and pushing it to the repository. Verify that the pipeline is triggered and that the code is built, tested, and deployed to the appropriate environment.
* Create a false case to check if integration and unit test work
* Make a code change or update in the Git repository to check if pipeline is integrated with Git.
