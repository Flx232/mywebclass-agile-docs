# Story: Monitor
## Description: Able to monitor the health and performance of our website, so that we can proactively detect and resolve issues before they affect our users.
## Tasks 
* Integrate the monitoring tool into the project's DevOps processes. 
* Define and configure the necessary metrics to be tracked by the monitoring system. 
* Set up alerts and notifications for potential issues or outages. 
* Test the monitoring system and ensure it is working as expected.
## Test Plan
* Verify the integration of the monitoring tool into the project's DevOps processes.
* Test the collection of relevant data for monitoring the project's infrastructure.
* Test the integration of the monitoring tool with other DevOps tools.
* Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are critical for the success of the project.
* Determine how each KPI will be tracked and measured. 
* Set up alerts and notifications to be triggered when KPIs fall outside of acceptable ranges.
* Test the alerts and notifications by triggering a simulated issue or outage that meets the threshold for the alert.
* Simulate various scenarios that may cause issues or outages, such as increased traffic or hardware failures, and check if the monitoring system correctly detects and alerts on these scenarios. 
* Test the notifications and alerts by triggering specific events or thresholds and verifying that the appropriate teams or individuals receive the alerts in a timely manner.
