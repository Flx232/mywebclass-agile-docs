# Story: Easily deploy new features and bug fixes to production
## Description: easily deploy new features and bug fixes to production, so that our customers can benefit from the latest improvements to our web application.
## Tasks
* Configure automated testing for each build. 
* Create deployment scripts that can be run automatically. 
* Implement a rollback mechanism in case of deployment failures.
##Test Plan
* Check for automated tests in each build: Verify that there are automated tests that run as part of the build process for each code change or commit. 
* Review test results: Check the results of automated tests in each build to ensure that they are passing or failing as expected. Make sure that failing tests are identified and addressed promptly.
* Check if deployment scripts are version-controlled: Ensure that the deployment scripts are properly version-controlled and can be easily accessed by the team. 
* Run deployment scripts on a test environment: Set up a test environment and attempt to run the deployment scripts. Verify if the scripts can be executed automatically without any manual intervention.
* Simulate a deployment failure by intentionally introducing a bug or error in the code. 
* Initiate the deployment process and monitor it for any failures. 
* Once the deployment failure is detected, check if the rollback mechanism is automatically triggered.
