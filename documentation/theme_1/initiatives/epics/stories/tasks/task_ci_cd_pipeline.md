# Task: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
## Description: Our goal is to set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment for our website.
##Test Plan
# Test Plan for Setting up CI/CD Pipelines for Automated Testing and Deployment

## Objectives
- To automate the testing and deployment processes to increase efficiency and reduce manual errors.
- To enable quick feedback on code changes and facilitate the Build Measure Learn cycle of Lean Management practice.
- To ensure that the deployment pipeline adheres to the development and production environment configurations.

## Testing Scope
- Test the pipeline setup and configuration for continuous integration and delivery.
- Test the pipeline for end-to-end functionality from development to deployment.

## Testing Approaches
- Automated testing will be performed using testing frameworks such as Selenium, Jest, and Pytest.
- Manual testing will be performed on the user interface to ensure ease of use and that all necessary functionality is in place.
- Non-functional testing will be performed to ensure performance, security, and compatibility with different browsers and devices.

## Test Environment
- Development, testing, and production environments will be set up to test and deploy the code changes.
- The testing environment will be a replica of the production environment.

## Testing Schedule
- Testing will be performed on each code change committed to the repository.
- Integration testing will be performed on a daily basis.
- Acceptance testing will be performed prior to deployment to the production environment.

## Test Cases
1. Test the pipeline setup and configuration:
    - Verify that the pipeline is set up correctly and all necessary plugins and tools are installed.
    - Verify that the pipeline is properly configured to build, test, and deploy the code.
    - Verify that the pipeline is properly integrated with the version control system.
2. Test the pipeline for end-to-end functionality:
    - Verify that the code is properly built and tested before deployment.
    - Verify that the deployment process is automated and error-free.
    - Verify that the deployed code is functioning correctly in the production environment.
3. Test non-functional requirements:
    - Verify that the performance of the application meets the required standards.
    - Verify that the security of the application is not compromised during deployment.
    - Verify that the application is compatible with different browsers and devices.

## Risks and Mitigation
- The pipeline may not be properly integrated with the version control system, which could lead to errors in the code. To mitigate this risk, regular testing will be performed on the pipeline.
- The pipeline may not be able to handle high traffic volumes, leading to slower response times. To mitigate this risk, performance testing will be performed regularly.
- The pipeline may not be secure, leading to data breaches or other security issues. To mitigate this risk, security testing will be performed regularly.
- The pipeline may not be compatible with different browsers and devices, leading to user frustration. To mitigate this risk, compatibility testing will be performed regularly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The pipeline is set up and configured correctly.
- The pipeline is properly integrated with the version control system.
- The pipeline is automated and error-free.
- The deployed code is functioning correctly in the production environment.
- The performance, security, and compatibility of the application meet the required standards.
