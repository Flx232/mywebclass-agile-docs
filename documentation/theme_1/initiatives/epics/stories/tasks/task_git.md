# Task: Set up version control system (e.g. Git)
## Description: The goal is to set up a version control system to document and control changes to our website.
##Test Plan
# Test Plan:
## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the version control system is set up properly and that it facilitates efficient and effective product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development.

## Scope
This test plan will cover the following areas:
- Setting up Git on the local machine
- Setting up a remote Git repository
- Setting up Git branches
- Ensuring proper version control practices are followed

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1: Setting up Git on the local machine
#### Test Steps:
1. Verify that Git is not installed on the local machine
2. Install Git on the local machine
3. Verify that Git is installed properly by running the command "git --version"
4. Verify that Git is configured properly by running the command "git config --list"

### Test Case 2: Setting up a remote Git repository
#### Test Steps:
1. Create a new remote Git repository on a hosting service (e.g. GitHub)
2. Clone the repository onto the local machine
3. Verify that the repository is cloned properly by checking the files and directories in the repository
4. Make changes to the local repository and commit them
5. Push the changes to the remote repository
6. Verify that the changes are reflected in the remote repository

### Test Case 3: Setting up Git branches
#### Test Steps:
1. Create a new branch in the local repository
2. Make changes to the new branch
3. Merge the new branch with the master branch
4. Verify that the merge is successful and that the changes are reflected in the master branch

### Test Case 4: Ensuring proper version control practices are followed
#### Test Steps:
1. Verify that all changes are made on a branch, rather than directly on the master branch
2. Verify that commits are made frequently and are accompanied by descriptive commit messages
3. Verify that commits are pushed to the remote repository regularly
4. Verify that merge conflicts are resolved properly and that the master branch is always stable

## Conclusion
This test plan has successfully tested the implementation of Git version control system for efficient and effective product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development. The test cases have verified that Git is set up properly and that proper version control practices are being followed.
