# Task: Implement infrastructure as code using tools such as Terraform
## Description: Our goal is to implement infrastructure as code for ease of development of our website.
##Test Plan
# Test Plan: Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform

## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the infrastructure as code using Terraform is implemented correctly to facilitate the lean management practice of build measure, lean so that we can focus on product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development.

## Scope
This test plan will cover the following areas:
- Infrastructure as code implementation using Terraform
- Verification of infrastructure setup using Terraform plan and apply commands
- Integration of Terraform with version control system (e.g. Git)
- Automated testing of Terraform scripts

## Test Environment
The test environment will consist of the following:
- Virtual machines (VMs) running on cloud providers (e.g. AWS, GCP)
- Terraform installed on the local development environment
- Version control system (e.g. Git)
- Automated testing tools (e.g. Terratest)

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1: Verify infrastructure setup using Terraform plan command
**Objective:** To verify that Terraform scripts can be validated without affecting the actual infrastructure.

**Steps:**
1. Clone the Terraform repository.
2. Run `terraform plan` command to generate an execution plan.
3. Verify that the execution plan is generated without any errors.
4. Verify that the execution plan is consistent with the expected infrastructure changes.

**Expected Results:** Terraform plan should generate an execution plan consistent with the expected infrastructure changes without any errors.

### Test Case 2: Verify infrastructure setup using Terraform apply command
**Objective:** To verify that Terraform scripts can be applied to set up the infrastructure correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Clone the Terraform repository.
2. Run `terraform apply` command to apply the changes to the infrastructure.
3. Verify that the infrastructure is set up correctly.
4. Verify that the applied changes are consistent with the expected infrastructure changes.

**Expected Results:** Terraform apply should set up the infrastructure correctly without any errors and the applied changes should be consistent with the expected infrastructure changes.

### Test Case 3: Verify integration with version control system
**Objective:** To verify that Terraform scripts can be integrated with version control system (e.g. Git).

**Steps:**
1. Clone the Terraform repository.
2. Verify that the repository is correctly configured to use the version control system.
3. Make changes to the Terraform script and commit the changes to the repository.
4. Verify that the changes are reflected in the repository and can be applied using `terraform apply` command.

**Expected Results:** Terraform scripts should be successfully integrated with the version control system and changes made to the scripts should be reflected in the repository and can be applied using `terraform apply` command.

### Test Case 4: Verify automated testing of Terraform scripts
**Objective:** To verify that automated testing tools (e.g. Terratest) can be used to test Terraform scripts.

**Steps:**
1. Set up automated testing tools (e.g. Terratest) for Terraform scripts.
2. Write automated tests for Terraform scripts.
3. Run the automated tests.
4. Verify that the tests are executed without any errors.

**Expected Results:** Automated testing tools should be successfully set up for Terraform scripts and the tests should be executed without any errors.

## Conclusion
This test plan ensures that infrastructure as code using Terraform is implemented correctly to facilitate the lean management practice of build measure, lean so that we can focus on product development using a pull process rather than a push process for feature development.
