# Task: Implement user consent options for data handling (GDPR).
## Description: The goal is to have our website give users options to how they want their data to be handled
##Test Plan
## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the implementation of user consent options for data handling (GDPR) is functioning as intended and is compliant with GDPR regulations.

## Scope
This test plan will cover the following areas:
- User interface for consent options
- Backend logic for data handling based on user consent options
- Data storage and retrieval based on user consent options

## Test Environment
The test environment will consist of the following:
- Development environment for implementing user consent options
- Test environment for validating user consent options implementation

## Test Cases
### User Interface
#### Test Case 1: Verify that user can view and modify their consent options
1. Navigate to the page where users can modify their consent options
2. Verify that user can view their current consent options
3. Modify the consent options and verify that the changes are saved

#### Test Case 2: Verify that user is prompted to provide consent when required
1. Navigate to a page where consent is required to proceed
2. Verify that user is prompted to provide consent before proceeding
3. Verify that user can modify their consent options from the prompt

### Backend Logic
#### Test Case 3: Verify that data handling is based on user consent options
1. Modify the user's consent options to restrict certain data handling
2. Verify that the data handling is restricted based on the user's consent options
3. Modify the user's consent options to allow the previously restricted data handling
4. Verify that the data handling is allowed based on the user's consent options

#### Test Case 4: Verify that user data is deleted upon request
1. Submit a request to delete user data
2. Verify that the user data is deleted and no longer accessible

### Data Storage and Retrieval
#### Test Case 5: Verify that user data is stored based on consent options
1. Modify the user's consent options to restrict certain data storage
2. Verify that the restricted data is not stored based on the user's consent options
3. Modify the user's consent options to allow the previously restricted data storage
4. Verify that the data is stored based on the user's consent options

#### Test Case 6: Verify that user data is retrievable based on consent options
1. Modify the user's consent options to restrict certain data retrieval
2. Verify that the restricted data is not retrievable based on the user's consent options
3. Modify the user's consent options to allow the previously restricted data retrieval
4. Verify that the data is retrievable based on the user's consent options

## Acceptance Criteria
- User can view and modify their consent options
- User is prompted to provide consent when required
- Data handling is based on user consent options
- User data is deleted upon request
- User data is stored and retrieved based on consent options

## Conclusion
This test plan covers the necessary test cases to ensure that the implementation of user consent options for data handling (GDPR) is compliant and functioning as intended.
