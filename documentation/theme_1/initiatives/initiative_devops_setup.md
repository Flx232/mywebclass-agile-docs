# Initiative: Setup DevOps processes that will support development
## Description: The goal is to setup DevOps that will assist with the creation of the website.
## Epics
* [Continuous Integration and Deployment](../../theme_1/initiatives/epics/epic_continuous_int_and_deploy.md)
* [Monitoring and Logging](../../theme_1/initiatives/epics/epic_monitering_and_logging.md)
* [Infrastructure as Code](../../theme_1/initiatives/epics/epic_infra_as_code.md)

Test Plan
* Check if the code is automatically built and tested: Verify if the code changes made by developers are automatically built and tested.
* Check if deployment is automated: Verify if the deployment process is automated, meaning that changes made in the code are automatically deployed to the testing or staging environment.
* Check if deployments are consistent: Verify that the deployment process is consistent across all environments, from development to production.
* Check if all the required logs are being generated and stored in a central location.
* Ensure that the logging system is configured to alert on errors and warnings in real-time.
* Verify that the alerts are being sent to the appropriate stakeholders in a timely manner.
* Test the logging and monitoring systems to ensure they are functioning properly.
* Check if the code for infrastructure is properly versioned and stored in a repository, such as Git.
* Check if the code is properly documented, with clear comments and instructions on how to use and modify it.
* Check if the code follows best practices for infrastructure as code, such as using a declarative approach, using variables, and separating configuration from code.
